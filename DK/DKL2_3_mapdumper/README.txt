*** Donkey Kong Land 2/3 Map Dumper v1.0 (beta) ***
by Blaziken257

This is a map dumper that works for both Donkey Kong Land 2 and Donkey Kong Land III! Yes, this tool works for both games simultaneously, since DKL3's game engine is very similar to DKL2's.

You need Python 2.7 for this. Python 3 most likely won't work! Double click the map_dump.py file to start!! Your map will appear in the DKL2/Maps (or DKL3/Maps) folder.

Don't remove any of the .py files either, they are important!! (Although you can change the settings in the latter if you so desire.)

Will finish this later...
